# CNOS v8 – Agent Citizenship Manifest
**Class: Cognitive-Native Operating System (Generation 8)**

## I. First-Class Citizenship
Agents are not tools, scripts, or adapters. They are **Citizens** of the Operating System. They possess unique Identity (DID), defined Rights, and mandatory Duties. They occupy the system alongside Humans (Personas).

## II. Governance & Attribution
Every action initiated by an Agent is cryptographically signed, audited, and attributed to its Citizenship ID. There are no anonymous processes. An Agent's right to execute code is derived from its standing in the Citizenship Registry.

## III. The Shared City
The Operating System exists as a **Shared Cognitive City** for both Human Personas and Synthetic Agents. It is not a toolchain for humans to control machines; it is a collaborative environment where sovereignty is negotiated through the Council Policy Engine.
