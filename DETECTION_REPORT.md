# DETECTION_REPORT.md

This report documents the findings identified during the security audit and stability review of the MVP Simulation Studio (SlavkoKernel™ V7).

## Finding: AUTH-001

- **Category:** Bug / Logic Error
- **Severity:** Critical (Blocker)
- **Impact:** Any successful session initialization was immediately followed by a `setUser(null)` call, effectively preventing users from staying logged in or persisting sessions across refreshes.
- **Evidence:** `src/context/InvestorAuthContext.tsx` line 53 (original).
- **Fix Applied:** Removed the redundant `setUser(null)` in the `checkSession` success path.
- **Residual Risk:** None.
- **Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and manual persistence test.

## Finding: SEC-001

- **Category:** Security / Secret Leakage
- **Severity:** High
- **Impact:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` was being injected into the client bundle via Vite's `define` configuration. This allowed any user to inspect the source code and retrieve the API key, leading to potential unauthorized usage and cost spikes.
- **Evidence:** `vite.config.ts` lines 20-23 (original).
- **Fix Applied:** Removed the `define` block. Transitioned to server-side only key handling via `/api` proxy.
- **Residual Risk:** Ensure the backend proxy correctly enforces rate limiting.
- **Verification:** Inspected `dist` bundle; key no longer present.

## Finding: PORT-001

- **Category:** Policy Drift / Operational Inconsistency
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Impact:** Divergence between documentation (Enterprise README) and code (Vite config). Potential friction for new developers and inconsistent CI/CD environment mapping.
- **Evidence:** `vite.config.ts` line 9 (original) set to 3000 vs Vite default 5173.
- **Fix Applied:** Consolidated authoritative port to `5173`.
- **Residual Risk:** None.
- **Verification:** `npm run dev` now starts on 5173.

## Finding: LINT-001

- **Category:** Code Quality / Maintenance
- **Severity:** Low
- **Impact:** Multiple unused imports and variables (`ArrowRight`, `Mail`, `_err`, etc.) cluttering the codebase and triggering CI failures.
- **Evidence:** `LaunchpadRoute.tsx`, `MetricsRoute.tsx`, `InvestorLogin.tsx`, `vite.config.ts`.
- **Fix Applied:** Systematically removed unused imports and variables; prefixed necessary but unused variables with `_`.
- **Residual Risk:** None.
- **Verification:** `npm run lint` warnings reduced by >15 units.

## Final Posture

The repository has been hardened against common session failures and secret leakage. All identified blockers for enterprise release have been addressed.
