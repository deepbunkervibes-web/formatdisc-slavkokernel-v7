{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\n## RECOMMENDATION\nOption 1: Imperial Landing Page\n\nTime-to-Impact favors the landing page unequivocally. A single HTML file can be deployed within hours via GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, immediately capturing email signups and generating social proof through traffic analytics. Technical documentation requires weeks of validation from engineering audiences, while pitch decks demand scheduled meetings and investor cycles. The landing page works 24/7 without human intervention.\n\nValue Demonstration is optimized through the landing page\'s ability to showcase all three engines simultaneously. Interactive sections can demonstrate SlavkoShell™\'s cryptographic deployments, SlavkoFusion™\'s design-to-code conversion, and SlavkoScore™\'s automated quality gates—creating immediate understanding across personas. Technical specs appeal only to engineers, while pitch decks reach limited investor circles.\n\nAudience Reach maximizes through SEO-optimized content targeting deployment workflows, design systems, and DevOps automation keywords. The landing page serves as a perpetual distribution engine through organic search, social sharing, and backlink opportunities—unlike closed-door pitch decks or GitHub-only technical documentation.\n\nStrategic Momentum is unlocked through captured email leads enabling community building, beta testing invitations, and partnership discussions. The landing page becomes the foundation for all future marketing efforts, providing measurable conversion data to iterate messaging while establishing SlavkoOS™ as the authoritative deployment OS category leader.\n\n---\n\n## DELIVERABLE\n<function_calls>\n<create-file file_path="index.html">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n    <meta charset="UTF-8">\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">\n    <title>SlavkoOS™ - Three-Engine Deployment Operating System</title>\n    <meta name="description" content="SlavkoOS™ eliminates the need for deployment teams.

Create feature branch from `develop`\n2. Implement changes with tests\n3. Submit pull request to `develop`\n4. Request code review from team\n5. Address feedback and merge\n\n## Frontend Development\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n- **React 18** with TypeScript\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **Tailwind CSS** for styling\n- **React Query** for server state\n- **React Hook Form** for forms\n- **Zod** for validation\n- **React Router** for navigation\n\n### Component Guidelines\n\n1. **Use Functional Components with Hooks**\n```typescript\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  variant: \'primary\' | \'secondary\'\n  onClick: () => void\n}\n\nexport function Button({ children, variant, onClick }: ButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <button \n      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}\n      onClick={onClick}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n2. **Follow Composition Pattern**\n```typescript\nexport function Card({ children, className }: CardProps) {\n  return <div className={`card ${className}`}>{children}</div>\n}\n\nCard.Header = function CardHeader({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return <div className="card-header">{children}</div>\n}\n\nCard.Body = function CardBody({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return <div className="card-body">{children}</div>\n}\n```\n\n3. **Use TypeScript Strictly**\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: string\n  email: string\n  firstName: string\n  lastName: string\n  role: UserRole\n}\n\ninterface UserCardProps {\n  user: User\n  onUpdate: (user: Partial<User>) => void\n}\n```\n\n### State Management\n\n- **Local State**: useState for component state\n- **Server State**: React Query for API data\n- **Global State**: Context for auth, theme, etc.\n\n```typescript\n// Using React Query\nconst { data: users, isLoading, error } = useQuery({\n  queryKey: [\'users\'],\n  queryFn: () => userService.getUsers()\n})\n\n// Mutation\nconst createUserMutation = useMutation({\n  mutationFn: userService.createUser,\n  onSuccess: () => {\n    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [\'users\'] })\n    toast.success(\'User created successfully\')\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Styling Guidelines\n\n- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes\n- Follow mobile-first responsive design\n- Implement dark mode support\n- Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)\n\n```typescript\n// Responsive design\n<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">\n\n// Accessibility\n<button \n  className="btn btn-primary focus-ring"\n  aria-label="Create new project"\n>\n  Create Project\n</button>\n```\n\n## Backend Development\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n- **Node.js** with Express and TypeScript\n- **Prisma ORM** for database operations\n- **PostgreSQL** (production) / SQLite (development)\n- **JWT** for authentication\n- **Joi** for validation\n- **Winston** for logging\n\n### API Guidelines\n\n1. **RESTful Design**\n```typescript\n// GET /api/users?page=1&limit=10\n// POST /api/users\n// GET /api/users/:id\n// PUT /api/users/:id\n// DELETE /api/users/:id\n```\n\n2. **Consistent Response Format**\n```typescript\ninterface ApiResponse<T> {\n  success: boolean\n  data?: T\n  error?: string\n  message?: string\n}\n\ninterface PaginatedResponse<T> extends ApiResponse<T[]> {\n  pagination: {\n    page: number\n    limit: number\n    total: number\n    totalPages: number\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. **Error Handling**\n```typescript\nexport const asyncHandler = (fn: Function) => \n  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {\n    Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next)\n  }\n\n// In controllers\nexport const createUser = asyncHandler(async (req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  const result = await userService.createUser(req.body)\n  res.status(201).json(result)\n})\n```\n\n### Database Operations\n\nUse Prisma for type-safe database operations:\n\n```typescript\n// Create user\nconst user = await prisma.user.create({\n  data: {\n    email: userData.email,\n    firstName: userData.firstName,\n    lastName: userData.lastName,\n    passwordHash: hashedPassword,\n  },\n  select: {\n    id: true,\n    email: true,\n    firstName: true,\n    lastName: true,\n    role: true,\n  }\n})\n\n// Query with relations\nconst project = await prisma.project.findUnique({\n  where: { id },\n  include: {\n    owner: true,\n    team: true,\n    tasks: {\n      take: 10,\n      orderBy: { createdAt: \'desc\' }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Validation\n\nUse Joi for input validation:\n\n```typescript\nconst createUserSchema = Joi.object({\n  email: Joi.string().email().required(),\n  firstName: Joi.string().min(2).max(50).required(),\n  lastName: Joi.string().min(2).max(50).required(),\n  role: Joi.string().valid(...Object.values(UserRole)).required(),\n  password: Joi.string().min(8).required()\n})\n\n// In routes\nrouter.post(\'/\', validate(createUserSchema), userController.createUser)\n```\n\n### Authentication & Authorization\n\n```typescript\n// JWT middleware\nexport const authenticateToken = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {\n  const authHeader = req.headers[\'authorization\']\n  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(\' \')[1]\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ success: false, error: \'Access token required\' })\n  }\n\n  jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET, (err: any, user: any) => {\n    if (err) return res.status(403).json({ success: false, error: \'Invalid token\' })\n    req.user = user\n    next()\n  })\n}\n\n// Role-based authorization\nexport const requireRole = (roles: string[]) => {\n  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {\n    if (!req.user || !roles.includes(req.user.role)) {\n      return res.status(403).json({ success: false, error: \'Insufficient permissions\' })\n    }\n    next()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n### Frontend Testing\n\n```typescript\n// Component test with Vitest\nimport { render, screen } from \'@testing-library/react\'\nimport { Button } from \'@/components/Button\'\n\ndescribe(\'Button\', () => {\n  it(\'renders with correct text\', () => {\n    render(<Button>Click me</Button>)\n    expect(screen.getByRole(\'button\')).toHaveTextContent(\'Click me\')\n  })\n\n  it(\'calls onClick when clicked\', () => {\n    const handleClick = vi.fn()\n    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>)\n    screen.getByRole(\'button\').click()\n    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### Backend Testing\n\n```typescript\n// API endpoint test\nimport request from \'supertest\'\nimport { app } from \'@/app\'\n\ndescribe(\'Users API\', () => {\n  it(\'should create a new user\', async () => {\n    const userData = {\n      email: \'test@example.com\',\n      firstName: \'Test\',\n      lastName: \'User\',\n      password: \'password123\'\n    }\n\n    const response = await request(app)\n      .post(\'/api/users\')\n      .send(userData)\n      .expect(201)\n\n    expect(response.body.success).toBe(true)\n    expect(response.body.data.email).toBe(userData.email)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Database Development\n\n### Migrations\n\nCreate and apply database migrations:\n\n```bash\n# Create migration\nnpx prisma migrate dev --name add_user_table\n\n# Apply migrations\nnpx prisma migrate deploy\n\n# Reset database\nnpx prisma migrate reset\n```\n\n### Seeding\n\nSeed development data:\n\n```typescript\n// prisma/seed.ts\nimport { PrismaClient } from \'@prisma/client\'\nimport bcrypt from \'bcryptjs\'\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient()\n\nasync function main() {\n  // Create admin user\n  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(\'admin123\', 12)\n  await prisma.user.create({\n    data: {\n      email: \'admin@enterprise.com\',\n      firstName: \'Admin\',\n      lastName: \'User\',\n      role: \'ADMIN\',\n      passwordHash: hashedPassword,\n    }\n  })\n}\n\nmain()\n  .catch((e) => {\n    console.error(e)\n    process.exit(1)\n  })\n  .finally(async () => {\n    await prisma.$disconnect()\n  })\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Frontend\n\n1. **Code Splitting**\n```typescript\n// Lazy load components\nconst ProjectDetailPage = lazy(() => import(\'@/pages/projects/ProjectDetailPage\'))\n\n// Route-level splitting\n<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n  <Route path="/projects/:id" element={<ProjectDetailPage />} />\n</Suspense>\n```\n\n2. **Optimize Images**\n```typescript\n// Use Next.js Image component or optimize manually\n<img \n  src="/api/optimised-image?src=project.jpg&w=800&q=80"\n  alt="Project screenshot"\n  loading="lazy"\n/>\n```\n\n3. **Cache API Calls**\n```typescript\n// Configure React Query\nconst queryClient = new QueryClient({\n  defaultOptions: {\n    queries: {\n      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes\n      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Backend\n\n1. **Database Indexing**\n```typescript\n// Prisma schema\nmodel Project {\n  id        String   @id @default(cuid())\n  name      String\n  ownerId   String   @map("owner_id")\n  \n  @@index([ownerId])\n  @@index([status])\n  @@index([createdAt])\n}\n```\n\n2. **Query Optimization**\n```typescript\n// Use select to limit returned fields\nconst users = await prisma.user.findMany({\n  select: {\n    id: true,\n    email: true,\n    firstName: true,\n    lastName: true,\n  }\n})\n\n// Use pagination\nconst projects = await prisma.project.findMany({\n  skip: (page - 1) * limit,\n  take: limit,\n  orderBy: { createdAt: \'desc\' }\n})\n```\n\n## Debugging\n\n### Frontend Debugging\n\n- Use React DevTools\n- Vue DevTools (if applicable)\n- Browser developer tools\n- Network tab for API calls\n\n### Backend Debugging\n\n- Use VS Code debugger\n- Add logging with Winston\n- Use database query logs\n- Profile with Node.js profiler\n\n```typescript\n// Debug configuration (.vscode/launch.json)\n{\n  "version": "0.2.0",\n  "configurations": [\n    {\n      "name": "Debug Backend",\n      "type": "node",\n      "request": "launch",\n      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/backend/src/index.ts",\n      "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/backend/dist/**/*.js"],\n      "runtimeArgs": ["-r", "tsx/cjs"],\n      "env": {\n        "NODE_ENV": "development"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Environment Setup\n\n### VS Code Extensions\n\nRecommended extensions for development:\n\n- TypeScript Importer\n- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense\n- Prisma\n- Thunder Client (API testing)\n- GitLens\n- Prettier\n- ESLint\n\n### Development Scripts\n\n```json\n{\n  "scripts": {\n    "dev": "concurrently \\"npm run dev:backend\\" \\"npm run dev:frontend\\"",\n    "dev:frontend": "cd frontend && npm run dev",\n    "dev:backend": "cd backend && npm run dev",\n    "test": "npm run test:backend && npm run test:frontend",\n    "lint": "npm run lint:frontend && npm run lint:backend",\n    "db:reset": "cd backend && npx prisma migrate reset",\n    "db:seed": "cd backend && npx prisma db seed"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Follow the coding standards\n2. Write tests for new features\n3. Update documentation\n4. Use conventional commits\n5. Request code review\n6. Ensure CI/CD passes\n\n## Common Issues & Solutions\n\n### Frontend\n\n- **HMR not working**: Check Vite configuration and port conflicts\n- **Type errors**: Run `npm run build` to catch all type issues\n- **Styling issues**: Verify Tailwind CSS configuration\n\n### Backend\n\n- **Database connection**: Check DATABASE_URL format\n- **Migration issues**: Reset database and re-run migrations\n- **JWT errors**: Verify JWT_SECRET is set correctly\n\nThis development guide provides the foundation for productive development on the Enterprise Dashboard application.\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}
