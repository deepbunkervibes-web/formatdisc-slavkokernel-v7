## Slide 2: **The €35M Compliance Crisis**

**EU AI Act Deadline: 2025**
4,300+ high-risk AI systems must be certified

**Current Reality:**

* 87% of AI systems fail deterministic requirements (Article 15)
* Black-box decisions = No audit trails = Legal liability
* Traditional compliance: 6-12 months, €500K+ costs

**The Penalty:** €35M or 6% global revenue for non-compliance

---

## Slide 3: **Our Solution: Deterministic AI Governance**

**SlavkoKernel v12** — The Compliance Operating System

```bash
$ slavko deploy --config compliance.yaml  
[DEPLOYMENT CEREMONY INITIATED]  
✓ Temperature locked at 0.0 (Deterministic)  
✓ Audit trails: cryptographically signed  
✓ Human oversight: real-time pause/override  
[SYSTEM: EU AI ACT COMPLIANT]
```

**Core Innovation:** OS layer that makes ANY AI system inherently compliant

---
