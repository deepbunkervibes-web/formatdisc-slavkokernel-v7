2. **Layer 2 (Multi-Agent Council):** Real-time quorum checks.
3. **Layer 3 (Sovereign Ledger):** Immutable sequence hash storage.

- **Operations:** FORMATDISC operates as a sole proprietorship in Zagreb.

- **Assessment:** High potential alignment with market needs, but requires due diligence on specific metric claims.
