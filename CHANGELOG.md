## [7.2.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Modular Studio Architecture**: Decomposed `MvpStudio.tsx` into specialized components in `src/components/studio/`.
- **Modular LandingPage**: Refactored `LandingPage.tsx` using `React.lazy`, `Suspense`, and `ErrorBoundary` for each section to ensure system-wide resilience.

- **SimulationWorkspace**: New modular container for council deliberations and artifact previews.
- **OLLAMA Status Badge**: Real-time visual indicator of local AI service connectivity.
- **Skeletal Loaders**: Added `Suspense` fallbacks with pulse animations for better perceived performance.
- **API Health Check**: New `/api/health` endpoint on the development server.

### Changed

- **Code Splitting**: Implemented `React.lazy` for heavy artifacts (ResultActions, MvpPreview, PitchDeck) to optimize initial bundle size.
- **Performance Optimization**: Memoized expensive UI components and callback handlers to reduce layout thrashing.
- **Navigation Polish**: Added passive scroll listeners and improved backdrop saturation for "God-Tier" UI transparency.

### Fixed

- **API Server Failures**: Resolved 500 errors by ensuring the local Express API server runs alongside Vite.
- **Simulation Stalls**: Implemented a 5-second timeout and graceful fallback for OLLAMA requests.
- **UI Overlap**: Fixed navigation header overlapping Studio content.
- **Asset Errors**: Resolved 404 console errors by adding a valid `favicon.svg`.
