# 📋 Project Task Log: MVP Simulation Studio

## 🏁 Phase 1: Core Stability & Verification

- [x] **Runtime Fixes**: Resolved `ResultActions` redeclaration and build errors.
- [x] **Local Environment**: `npm run dev:full` running successfully on ports 3000/3001.
- [x] **UI Verification**:
  - [x] Header Z-index & Padding (`pt-24`)
  - [x] Connection Badge (Dynamic statuses)
  - [x] Input Placeholder Typo
  - [x] Operational Flow Indicators
  - [x] Dynamic Input Hints
  - [x] "Explain to Regulator" Modal
- [x] **Audit Engine Core**:
  - [x] Expanded `AuditMetadata` interface.
  - [x] Implemented crypto-hashing for events.
  - [x] Updated `AuditTrail` UI to show full metadata (Prompt, Latency, Model).

## 🔨 Phase 2: "Audit Proof" Features (Current Focus)

These features ensure the promise of "The Truth" is mathematically verifiable.

- [x] **CSV Export**: Allow users to download the full ledger for external verification.
- [x] **Search & Filter**: Find specific decisions or agent votes.
- [x] **Ledger Refresh**: Real-time updates (Added "LIVE" indicator).
- [x] **Session Grouping**: Organize audits by simulation ID.
- [x] **Narrative Injection**:
  - [x] **Cinematic README**: Overhauled with "The Vow" arc.
  - [x] **Component Soul**: Injected narrative into `PhaseHeader`, `IdeaInput`, `SimulationWorkspace`, and `ResultActions`.
  - [x] **Centralized Copy**: All narrative tokens moved to `src/constants/phaseNarrative.ts`.

## 🎨 Phase 3: "God-Tier" Visuals

- [x] **Quantum Canvas**: Integrated 3D Three.js background reacting to phases and audit hashes.
- [x] **Cinematic Boot**: High-fidelity startup sequence implemented and synchronized with Kernel state.
